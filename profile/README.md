## Roadmap

Our journey is laid out with clear and strategic milestones to enhance Akeru's capabilities and reach:

- **Launching Subnet on Testnet**: Initiating our subnet operations on a test network to ensure stability and performance before mainnet deployment.
- **Launching Subnet on Mainnet**: Transitioning our subnet to the mainnet to bring full operational capabilities to all users.
- **Support for Document Parsing and Retrieval**: Implementing advanced features for parsing documents and retrieving information, enhancing our platform's utility in data management and AI-driven insights.
- **Support for LLM Function Calling**: Expanding our API to include function calling capabilities for large language models (LLMs), broadening the scope of interactions and functionalities available through Akeru.
- **Rolling Out Miners and Validators in Europe and Asia**: Strengthening our network's global footprint by setting up miners and validators across Europe and Asia to ensure decentralized benefits and enhanced network reliability.

These steps are designed to propel Akeru towards becoming a more robust, efficient, and globally recognized AI platform.
